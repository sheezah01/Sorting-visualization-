Sorting Visualization Project
Welcome to the Sorting Visualization Project! This project is designed to help you understand and visualize how different sorting algorithms work and compare their performance. Developed using C++, the project includes a variety of popular sorting algorithms, each demonstrating unique approaches to sorting data.

Features-
1.Visualization of multiple sorting algorithms
2.Comparative analysis of sorting speeds
3.User-friendly interface to observe sorting in real-time
4.Detailed performance metrics for each algorithm


Sorting Algorithms Implemented-
1.Selection Sort
2.Insertion Sort
3.Bubble Sort
4.Merge Sort
5.Quick Sort
6.Heap Sort
7.Shell Sort
8.Odd-Even Sort

Usage-
1.Follow the on-screen instructions to select the sorting algorithm you want to visualize.
2.Observe the sorting process and the time taken by each algorithm to complete.
3.Compare the efficiency of different algorithms based on their performance.
